Some of the techniques in the self defense curriculum mirror TMA. I think BJJ could stand to update its striking curriculum. My sense (limited sense) is that much of the striking curriculum is imported from MMA, but I would like to see the approach taken by (for instance) Krav Maga, which looks at ways to train high percentage low effort low technical difficulty strikes, as well as defenses against common (as measured by actual statistics) attacks. The KM self defense curriculum builds off of impulsive reactions instead of looking for the ""best"" way to defend something. I'm not really sold that the best defense of a bear hug involves a throw, when a series of elbows is probably good enough. ";no answer;no answer

Venum, returned an item and never got refund;Yearned to satisfy my 'fighting spirit' :P Looked it up, tried it out, fell in love on the first day - knew I was meant to do this ;To be honest, it's hard to explain. I've written it out six times and have erased it all. I think the part of training that makes all the heartache you've gone through over the years go away are the rare moments when your love and devotion to and for the art drowns out all the noise. It's when you're rolling and you no longer think about how you didn't get that stripe, or how you let yourself down at the last tourney, or how this beginner white belt has just passed your guard... it's when, instead, you're concentrated so much on what you're doing that nothing else matters. You just are there, in your gym, your home away from home, rolling. It's when you don't think about what you're gonna do next, you only do something next, and next, and next. You only do something now. I love this feeling of just... feeling. Living in the now, you know? It's a little bitty part of what Jiu-jitsu gives me. ;The heartache that comes with it. And the reasons for this are endless... a few examples, though? When I'm one of two people sitting out and my instructor asks the other person to roll. When someone I was promoted with at the same time receives a stripe and I don't. When I don't try my hardest during training, or a tournament and am ashamed of myself for it. And when I have put in more work than anyone else has for two plus years and my instructor chooses to give his attention to another blue belt, who doesn't devote nearly as much of their time to the mats as I do.

no answer;I have been doing indoor rock climbing for much of my adult life, but in summer 2014, there was a flood and the climbing wall was closed for several months, so I started looking for another fun physical activity. I had been interested in martial arts since childhood and tried karate for one quarter in undergrad, but it wasn't a good fit. I thought about trying judo but after doing some reading online, found out that BJJ came from judo but was practiced mostly on the ground, which works well for me because I have a disability that affects my balance and limits my ability to stand independently. (I use a powerchair to get around.) I showed up to the beginner class on day one and the rest is history.;Constantly figuring stuff out while rolling and occasionally getting submissions;Long warm-ups;no answer;Ronda Rousey
