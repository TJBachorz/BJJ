# Fitness and intrigue.
# I wanted to be a Ninja
# To leg lock my enemies 
# my room mate in college would by me beer if I went with him
# At this point in my life, partially for self-defense, but mostly to have 
# something to do. Martial arts in general is one of those perfect hobbies: 
#    it's cheap and it is simultaneously a mental, physical, social, and 
#    spiritual endeavor. BJJ is also one of the most challenging things 
#    I've dealt with in my life in all of those aspects as well. In short, 
#    it improves the quality of my life.
# Because the boxing coach looked really dodgy and the jiujitsu crew were much better organised, as well as better looking.
# Exercise without feeling like exercise. 
# I lost a fight to a jiu jitsu guy.
# I saw a video of Ottavia Bourdain climbing an ice cream shop owner like a tree and choking him to the ground.  This led me down a youtube rabbit hole and I thought, gosh that looks like fun!
# I saw that I could get a good workout while lying on soft mats.
# I was always into wrestling with my cousins and siblings, so my mom signed me up for my first Jiu-Jitsu class so I could learn how to do it properly.
# after this guy slept with my boyfriend and i needed to fuck people up
